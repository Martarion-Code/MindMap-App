# MindMap-App
## This is mindmap app that I created using react flow.

 Currently, at 8 July 2023, there is bug in React Flow that you can't add node when using drag feature in mobile, but it works on desktop. I already tell the React Flow development team for that. Maybe by the time you see this, the bug already solved, maybe not yet.
